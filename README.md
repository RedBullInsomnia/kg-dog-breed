# kg-dog-breed
Code for kaggle's Dog Breed Identification problem, https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification.

## Setup
I used the same environment as https://github.com/udacity/dog-project

Training data and testing data is to be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification and unzipped into `data/train` and `data/test`. The actual training data must then be generated by running `dataCleaning.py` to separate the training folder into a training and a validation set.

Then, all that is left is to generate the bottleneck features and training the model using the functions in `kg-dog-breed.py'.
